Release 0.3.0
=============

Major Changes (Read this part!)
-------------------------------

* Add a basic module system.
* Elm's JavaScript runtime is now distributed with the elm package.
  Previously it was available for download as an unversioned JavaScript
  file (elm-mini.js). It is now installed with the elm compiler as
  elm-runtime-0.3.0.js. Be sure to serve the Elm runtime system that matches
  the version of the compiler used to generate JavaScript. When working
  locally, the compiler will automatically use your local copy of this file.
* BREAKING CHANGE: rgb and rgba (in the color module) now take their red,
  green, and blue components as integers between 0 and 255 inclusive.
* Improve error messages for parse errors and runtime errors.


New Functions and Other Additions
---------------------------------

* Add support for keyboard events: Keyboard.Raw
* Add buttons in Signal.Input:
  button :: String -> (Element, Signal Bool)
* Add new basic element (an empty rectangle, good for adding spaces):
  rectangle :: Int -> Int -> Element
* Add (an awkwardly named) way to display right justified text: rightedText
* Add two basic libraries: Data.Char and Data.Maybe
* Add some new colors: magenta, yellow, cyan, gray, grey
* Add functions to Data.List module: take, drop
* Add functions to Prelude (the default imports):
  fst, snd, curry, uncurry, and a bunch of list functions
* Add --make, --separate-js, and --only-js flags to help compile
  with the new module system.
